I'm Siddharth Shukla, and I'm working on this web application.
This is a conversational voice controlled news web application.
This project enables you to add voice capability for searching new headlines across the globe.
This is essentially a news project that provides the most recent news headlines.
You can obtain the most recent news simply by asking for it.
In this project, I'm utilising Alan AI features.
The goal is to provide the most recent news from all different platforms on a specific platform.
To avoid users having to visit multiple websites to find different types of news.
Providing the most relevant and significant news headlines from the most popular news websites.

This web application is subdivided into four sections.
News by Categories :
Try saying : Give me the latest Technology news.
News by Terms :
Try saying : Whatâ€™s up with Elon musk.
News by Sources :
Try saying : I want news from CNN.
Latest News :
Try saying : Give me the latest news.


This web application was built with ReactJs technology.
In this web application, I have used the features of Alan AI.
This project is already live on the internet.
My web application is hosted on netlify.com
It is deployed on the same platform.
I've also published my code on Github.
